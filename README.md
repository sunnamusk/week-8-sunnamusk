# Solving an SDG Problem with Data (Choose Your SDG)
Part 1: SDG Selection and Problem Definition
SDG Selection: Choose an SDG that resonates with you (e.g., SDG 3: Good Health, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy).
Problem Definition: Identify a specific problem within that SDG. For example:
SDG 3: Access to healthcare in rural areas.
SDG 7: Energy access for low-income households.
Part 2: Database Design
ERD: Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on your problem. Identify entities such as Users, Healthcare Facilities, Energy Sources, etc.
Schema: Write SQL statements to create tables. For instance:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    location VARCHAR(100)
);
Sample Data: Populate your tables with relevant sample data to reflect real-world scenarios.
Part 3: SQL Programming
Data Retrieval: Write queries to retrieve data relevant to your problem.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE location = 'Rural Area';
Data Analysis: Create queries to generate insights, such as average distance to the nearest healthcare facility.
Part 4: Data Analysis Using Excel
Import Data: Use Excel's data connection features to import data from your database.
Analysis: Create pivot tables and charts to visualize the data.
Dashboard: Design an interactive dashboard that summarizes key insights.
Part 5: Integration and Testing
Integration Documentation: Document how you import data into Excel, including any transformations or cleaning steps.
Testing: Validate that the data in Excel matches the data in your database.
Part 6: Presentation
Pitch Deck: Create a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation covering:

Project overview and SDG alignment
Problem definition and significance
Database design and schema
Key insights from data analysis
Excel dashboard demonstration
Delivery: Prepare to present your pitch deck, clearly demonstrating how your project addresses the SDG problem.
